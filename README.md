# cub3d #6

My sixth project of the 42 school Codam. The goal here is to learn about raycasting and creating your own 3d maze (2d actually) by using the minilibx library.

Compile with ```make```or ```make bonus```to include some of the listed bonuses. Run the program followed by a path to a ```.cub``` file to start.
